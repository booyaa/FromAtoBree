A route planner for Lord of the Rings Online. The initial release will be a combo web and command line release. 

If you need an in-game plugin might I suggest Vinny's excellent [TravelRef](http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info524-Travellocationsreference.html). Vinny has kindly given permission for me to use the stable data in this plugin, which has help speed up the development of this app.
